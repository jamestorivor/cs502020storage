# cs502020storage

CS50x and CS50py 2022 code that ive written. 
Week 8 website code is kinda corrupted
My final project was never completed.
Completed all the problemsets from week 1-9

I learnt alot from cs50x and cs50python

My biggest takeaway is the basic understanding of languages and coding in general
The 2 courses have taught me how to code but not how to programme

Looking forward to creating more repositories that dont suck as much as this one
