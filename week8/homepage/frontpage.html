                    <p>I started working on this in early July 2022 and finally finished it<br>
                        in late September 2022. If i had more time to work on this seriously,<br>
                        I think i could have finished it in a much shorter time.<br>                        
                    </p><br>
                    <p class="space">
                        When i started working on this, i hated web development as i found that I<br>
                        spent most of my time searching for the most basic CSS things and I felt like I<br>
                        would never be able to complete it. I then watched a CSS tutorial and was able to<br>
                        understand more and eventually after ALOT of practice, finally make my thoughts a reality.<br>
                        I think ive come to enjoy web devlopment a whole lot more :).
